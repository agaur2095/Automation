# Automation of Data Collection from the PDF's

Automating the extraction of data from PDFs and storing it in Excel files can greatly streamline data processing workflows. Python, with its robust libraries, offers powerful tools to accomplish this task efficiently.

The ideation behind this workflow is to save the effort of manually entering data from PDFs and create a structured format (Excel, CSV, SQL tables) for reporting and insights purposes.

This is the prototype of work that I performed during my work experience in collaboration with several teams like Finance, Membership/Loyalty, Claims, and Marketing to fulfill data requests with significant effort savings.
